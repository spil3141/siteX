      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Machine Learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. In general, a machine learning problem
        considers a set of <a href="#">n samples</a> of data and then tries to predict properties of new unknown data.
        There are three main types of machine learning, plus hybrids of these three.

      <ol>
        <li>Supervised Learning</li>
        <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
        <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Supervised Learning</h4>
      <p>
        The main goal is for a model (piece of code/algorithm) to learn from labeled Training Data that allows
        it to make Predictions about unseen or future data.Â Here a set of samples where the desired output signals
        are already known.Supervised Learning enable mainly two tasks.

        <li>Regression</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Data Preprocessing</h1>
      <h2>Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        In Machine Learning, Dataset refers to the data which is given as input to an algorithm or use to test
        an algorithm's predictive accuracy.In other words, machine learning goal is to create computer softwares
        that learns from pass "experiences" and make predictions ( among other tasks ). The "experience" refers to
        the data that have been recorded by people and stored in a specific format.
        This data is what we refer to as a Dataset. Dataset comes in two parts.
