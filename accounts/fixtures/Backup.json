Regression</blockquote><h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2><blockquote>Unlike supervised learning, It involves creating a model that make generalization based on data that are not labeled by human thus \"Supervised\". Unsupervised Learning involves task like clustering of data. clustering is a task the machine learning softwares undergo by grouping objects into \"cluster\". These clustering algorithms fall into one of two methods:</blockquote><blockquote><br>1. Flat Clustering&nbsp;<br>2. Hierarchical Clustering&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><b><u>Flat Clustering:</u></b><br>- these algorithms divides the samples into a set of clusters without relating the clusters to each other.<br>- The goal is simply to come up with a partitioning such that all samples in one cluster are most similar to each other while being dissimilar from the samples in all other clusters.<br> - Many flat clustering algorithms require the number of clusters to be specified up front.<br> <u><b>Hierarchical Clustering:</b></u><br>- In hierarchical clustering, the number of cluster does not have to be specified. Instead, the hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters.<br>- Similar samples are grouped into one cluster, similar clusters are again grouped into one huge-cluster and so on.<br> - This is done recursively until one cluster is left, which contains everything.<br>- This comes at the cost of lower efficientcy (grouping accuracy).&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p class=\"\"><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 30px;\">Reinforcement Learning</span></p><blockquote>...</blockquote><h2><br></h2><p><br></p>",

        "text": "<p>There are questions that until now people have tried to answer but these questions are so hard that the great philosophers of our time can only theorize. One of these questions is \" How will the Universe end ?\". This is a story that will give you an insight on what happened in the beginning and what is to come at its end. </p><p>    The beginning, our universe started with an explosion that grow in size from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_realm\">quantum scale</a> to the size of a pencil tip in Nano seconds. Everything in existence, from your friends, family, favorite food, university, crush etc was created at that point in time. At the explosion, the expansion began and the universe started to grow in size. At this time, the four fundamental forces came in to effect. Gravity, weak and strong interactions, and Electromagnetism were created. Also present was hydrogen, the workings of how the energy from the Big-Bang transform into matter ( hydrogen ) will be explain in future episodes. But from hydrogen and the four fundamental forces, everything in existence formed through complex processes. </p><p>    The End, unlike our universe beginning with a massive but quantum explosion there is a theory that says it will end with something called the \"Big Freeze\" or \"Heat Death\". This is a possible scenario predicted to be the end of everything. This can be naively explain, due to something called \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=dark+energy&amp;oq=dark+energy&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.1582j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">dark energy</a>\". the expansion of the universe seem to be increasing and at this rate billions of years from now when all the stars are too far apart and have dead there will be no more light. It will be a universe of darkness and without heat ,hence \"Heat Death\"</p><p>    In conclusion, these are just possible theories and we are talking about billions of years. At the rate of technological improvement and human natural instinct for survivor there is a high possibility for us to figure out a way to overcome those obstacles. :)&nbsp;</p>",
